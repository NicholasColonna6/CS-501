Assignment 8 Project:
We created the game BreakOut (or Brick Breaker) for our final project. In the file 'BreakOut Directions.txt'
you will find instructions on how to play, as well as a brief description of the game. Please let us know if
you have an questions/comments/concerns about our program, or if you have any issues running it. Thank you!



NOTE: In order for the game to play, you will need two libraries, ACM.jar and ObjectDrawV1.1.2.jar, which are
both included in the 'lib' folder in our submission. These will then need to be configured to the build path. 
Instructions on how to do this are below, for your reference.

1. Right-click the project/class folder and select "Properties"
2. Select "Java Build Path" on the left side, then click into the "Libraries" tab.
3. Now, click the "Add External JARS..." button
4. Locate and enter the 'lib' folder submitted with this program. Select the 'acm.jar' and the 
'objectdrawV1.1.2.jar' files, then click "Open"
5. Click "OK" / "Apply and Close" to save the changes and apply the JAR files. 
6. If everything worked, there should be an item called "Referenced Libraries" now in the project folder
that contains both the JARS installed.
