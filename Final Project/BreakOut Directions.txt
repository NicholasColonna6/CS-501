BreakOut Game Directions:

The goal of the game is to break all of the bricks with the ball without letting the ball drop 
below the paddle.

After starting the program, the user left-clicks to start the game. The ball will then proceed
upwards from the paddle on the bottom, breaking any brick that it strikes. To control the paddle,
the user uses the left arrow key to slide left and the right arrow key to slide right. Depending on
where the ball strikes the paddle, the ball could deflect leftwards or rightwards. If the ball falls 
below the paddle, the paddle and ball will reset in the center and the user must left-click to send 
the ball upwards again. If the ball falls below the paddle a second time, it is game over and the 
program has to be restarted to play again.
